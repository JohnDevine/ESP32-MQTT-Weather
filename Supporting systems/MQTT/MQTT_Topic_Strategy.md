# MQTT Topic Structure for Multi-Location Sensor Network

This structure supports multiple sites with various types of devices and sensors, each possibly having multiple instances. The topic format categorizes data by transmission type (iot/sensor), location, and device type, making it hierarchical and wildcard-friendly for efficient dashboard processing.

## ‚úÖ Topic Format

```
[type_of_data]/[site_name]/[device_type]/[device_id]
```

**Note:** All measurements for a device are published as a JSON payload to the device_id topic, not as separate MQTT topics.

## üîç Subscription Patterns

| Use Case                            | MQTT Subscription Topic               |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| All BMS data from Solar Blue        | `iot/solar_blue/bms/+`                |
| All BMS data from all IoT systems   | `iot/+/bms/+`                          |
| All engine data from any site       | `+/+/engine/+`                         |
| All camera data from all locations  | `+/+/camera/+`                         |
| All weather data from all sites     | `+/+/weather/+`                        |
| All data from Baanfarang            | `+/baanfarang/+/+`                     |
| Specific device from Solar Blue     | `iot/solar_blue/bms/bms1`              |
| **Weather Dashboard Node-RED**       | `+/+/weather/+`                        |

## üß© Optional Metadata Topics

Use retained topics for static metadata:

```
meta/solar_blue/location = {"lat": 8.1234, "lon": 98.5678}
meta/solar_blue/owner = "John D"
meta/solar_blue/engine/engine1/model = "Yanmar 3YM30"
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Naming Rules

- Use all **lowercase** for topic components
- Replace **spaces with underscores** in site names
- Stick to **descriptive device IDs** (`bms1`, `main`, `inverter1`)
- Use **JSON payloads** for all sensor data with consistent field naming
- Include **timestamps** in all payloads for data correlation
- Use **nested JSON objects** for complex devices with multiple subsystems

---

## üèÅ Summary

This structure provides:

- **Simplified topic hierarchy** - only 4 levels deep, ending at device_id
- **Consolidated data** - all measurements for a device in a single JSON payload
- **Easy filtering** by site, system, or specific device
- **Reduced MQTT overhead** - fewer topics, larger but more efficient payloads
- **Flexibility** for future expansion (more systems, locations, sensors)
- **Better data correlation** with timestamps in every payload

**Key Benefits:**
- Node-RED flows are simpler with single topic subscriptions per device
- InfluxDB ingestion is more efficient with batch data points
- Grafana queries can access all device metrics from single measurement
- Reduced MQTT broker load with fewer topic subscriptions
- **System-level filtering** enables device-type specific dashboards (weather, bms, engine)

## üìä InfluxDB Integration

Data is stored in InfluxDB v2 with the following structure:

**Tags:** `type_of_data`, `site_name`, `device_type`, `device_id`
**Measurement:** `Readings`
**Fields:** All sensor data (temperature, humidity, voltage, etc.)

### Example InfluxDB Line Protocol:
```
Readings,type_of_data=sensor,site_name=baanfarang,device_type=weather,device_id=main temperature=22.5,humidity=65.2,pressure=1013.25,lux=340.8,gas_resistance=0 1643208600000000000
```

## üéØ Grafana Dashboard Strategy

### Variable Hierarchy:
1. **site_name** - Primary selector (baanfarang, solar_blue)
2. **device_id** - Cascading selector (populated based on site_name)
3. **device_type** - Hard-coded in queries for sensor-specific dashboards

### Dashboard Types:
- **Weather Dashboard** - `device_type = "weather"` hardcoded
- **BMS Dashboard** - `device_type = "bms"` hardcoded  
- **Engine Dashboard** - `device_type = "engine"` hardcoded
- **Overview Dashboard** - All device types with device_type variable

### Node-RED Flow Strategy:
Each Node-RED flow subscribes to a specific `device_type` using wildcards:
- **Weather Flow**: `+/+/weather/+` (captures all weather devices from any site)
- **BMS Flow**: `+/+/bms/+` (captures all BMS devices from any site)  
- **Engine Flow**: `+/+/engine/+` (captures all engine devices from any site)

This approach allows each flow to process all devices of its type regardless of location or device_id.
