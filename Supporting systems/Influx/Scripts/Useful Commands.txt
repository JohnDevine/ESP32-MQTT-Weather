There is a web interface on http://192.168.1.5:8087
The default user/password is me/mypassword
It was setup in the docker-compose.yml in IOTstack 

First get a command line within the container
docker exec -it influxdb2 /bin/bash

Need an organisation under V2
influx org create --name solarblue

To create a bucket (bucket=database) with 1 year retention in organisation solarblue
influx bucket create -n BMS -r 8760h -o solarblue

To list buckets
influx bucket list --org solarblue

To drop/delete a bucket you need
influx bucket delete --name BMS --org solarblue

When setting up node the in nodered palette server it will request a authorisation “Token:”. You get the ID here. Copy the token it spits out.
This grants access to all current and future buckets in that organization.

influx auth create \

You can also list the tokens and grab the one you want .. not Token NOT ID
influx auth list --org solarblue
